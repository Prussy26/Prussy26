- 👋 Hi, I’m Lukáš Prusák and I am currently finishing my Master's degree in Cybernetics, Control and Measurements.

- 👀 I’m interested in programming embedded devices optimized for power efficiency or any other embedded systems.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on my Master's thesis, where I am trying to implement an automated testbed for SIL/PIL testing of embedded applications for RISC-V soft-core processor.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some great projects so I can use my hard skills in C programming and my soft skills in a team full of clever and friendly people.

- 📫 How to reach me? You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luk%C3%A1%C5%A1-prus%C3%A1k-57814a22b), but I have no photo, for now, so contact me, and we can grab a warm cup of tea 🍵 and discuss our future collaboration.
